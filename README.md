## Financial and Voting Analysis using Python

### PyBank

Analysis:

We have a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Using this dataset as a resources, we will analyze and summarize the financial record to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The average of the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

(How?)

We will use for loop in phyton to do all calculation and track all the change of month and profit/losses.

### PyPoll

Analysis:
We have a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

Using this dataset as a resources, we will analyze and summarize the poll voting record to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

(How?)

We will use for loop in phyton to calculate the total votes, extract each candidate name, and track the candidate voter count.
