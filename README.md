## Financial and Voting Analysis using Python

### PyBank

Analysis:

We have a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Using this dataset as a resources, we will analyze and summarize the financial record to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The average of the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

(How?)

We will use for loop in phyton to do all calculation and track all the change of month and profit/losses.

Result:
